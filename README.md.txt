Java
Sun Microsystems initially introduced Java, a programming language and computing platform, in 1995.
Java is still used in cutting-edge goods and digital services that are being developed for the future.
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java platform core classes, and auxiliary Java platform libraries make up the JRE.
To launch Java WebStart apps from a compatible web browser, all you need is the JRE, which is the runtime component of the Java platform.
Although these are included in the Java Programming Kit, it does not come with any development tools (JDK).

Java Swing
A component of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) used to develop window-based applications is the Java Swing tutorial.
It is totally developed in Java and constructed on top of the AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) API.
Java Swing offers lightweight, platform-independent components in contrast to AWT.
Classes for the Java Swing API, such as JButton, JTextField, JTextArea, JRadioButton, JCheckbox, JMenu, JColorChooser, etc., are provided by the javax.swing package.

NetBeans Installation
An integrated development environment (IDE) for Java is called NetBeans.
Applications can be created using NetBeans using a collection of modular software components known as modules.
The link to download and install NetBeans is mentioned below.

GitHub
Git is a distributed version conyrol system that is free and open source.
It is made to efficiently and quickly handle projects of all sizes.
With capabilities like affordable local branching, handy staging area, and numerous workflows, it surpasses SCM solutions.
You can find a link to install and configure git in the references below.
Github gives you access to your own dashboard for simple project adminsitration, enhanced code security with packages, efficient team management, better coding and simplecode hosting.

Steps/CLI Commands
1. Clone the main repository using 'git clone <branch url>'
2. Add/Update files such as README and .gitignore
3. Command 'git status' to check all the changes made to the file
